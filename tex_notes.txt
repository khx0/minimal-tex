* cross referencing between two different LaTeX documents:
Load the package
\usepackage{xr}
and specify the external document from which you want to reference something via
\externaldocument{fileB}
where fileB.tex must be the corresponding tex file within the same parent directory
as the file you are working in.

For mutual cross referencing between two TeX documents, which are in the same parent folder do the following:

file_A.tex:
…
\usepackage{xr}
\externaldocument{file_B}
…


file_B.tex
…
\usepackage{xr}
\externaldocument{file_A}
…

Then you can access all figure, table, equation and section labels (and so on) mutually.

By default the xr package does not add hyperlinks.
It only adds the label’s text.
If you have identical labels in the two documents you can add a prefix to avoid
ambiguity.

\externaldocument[SI]{si}
(e.g. to include the labels from the file si.tex)
And then in the main.tex file you can reference them
by \ref{SIlabelname}, where in the si.tex file
the label only appears as
\label{labelname}


* unbreakable space character:
In TeX the tilde ~ is an unbreakable space character.
Let’s say you want to reference some table in a text by writing:
… Table \ref{tab:myTable1}…
Then it can happen that Table and the actual table number get broken to different lines.
To avoid this us
… Table~\ref{tab:myTable1}…
instead. This is often the desired behavior in conjunction with \ref{…} or \cite{…} statements.

* use 
\begin{subequations}
…
\end{subequations}
To get the same equation number for all quations within this envrionment tag.
You can define multiple \begin{align}…\end{align} brackets within this above environment.

* greater equal / less equal symbols
In Tex both \geq and \ge can be used for the greated equal symbol “>=“.
Likewise both \leq and \le can be used for the smaller equal symbol “<=“.
For some reasons when using TeX in python’s matplotlib only the
former version of both, i.e. \geq and \leq work.
So there make sure to use this version for these symbols.
