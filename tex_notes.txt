* cross referencing between two different LaTeX documents:
Load the package
\usepackage{xr}
and specify the external document from which you want to reference something via
\externaldocument{fileB}
where fileB.tex must be the corresponding tex file within the same parent directory
as the file you are working in.

For mutual cross referencing between two TeX documents, which are in the same parent folder do the following:

file_A.tex:
…
\usepackage{xr}
\externaldocument{file_B}
…


file_B.tex
…
\usepackage{xr}
\externaldocument{file_A}
…

Then you can access all figure, table, equation and section labels (and so on) mutually.

By default the xr package does not add hyperlinks.
It only adds the label’s text.
If you have identical labels in the two documents you can add a prefix to avoid
ambiguity.

\externaldocument[SI]{si}
(e.g. to include the labels from the file si.tex)
And then in the main.tex file you can reference them
by \ref{SIlabelname}, where in the si.tex file
the label only appears as
\label{labelname}
